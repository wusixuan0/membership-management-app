# Membership Management App

### This is a simplified client-facing version of a membership management app. I got the idea from Uplifter, a Canadian-made membership software that provides a flexible, easy-to-set-up, and user-friendly registration system to national organizations like Skate Canada and Gymnastics Ontario.

install packages
### `npm install firebase`
### `npm install react-firebase-hooks`
### `npm install -g firebase-tools`

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
